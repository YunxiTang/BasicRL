how are you i am fine thank you have a nice day you too
at six that morning as he was making his last rounds the night watchman had seen the note nailed to the street door
come in without knocking and inform the police
a shortwhile later the inspector arrived with the intern
the two of them had searched the house for some evidence 
that might contradict the unmistakable breath of bitter almonds
but in the brief minutes the doctor needed to study the unfinished game
the inspector discovered an envelope among the papers on the desk
sealed with so much sealing wax that it had to be ripped to pieces to get the letter out
